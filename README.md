# PPT AUTOMATION PACKAGE
This is a package to automate repetitive tasks when creating technical instructions in Powerpoint using python-pptx library from scanny (https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx).

Writing this package has taught me how to:
- organize code and write a setup.py for installing the package using pip
- use argparse for parsing command line arguments
- write simple tests using unittest
- write a requirements file using pipreqs
- use git begginer commands
